I'm a Computer Science Junior from Florida International University and passionate about Applied Deep Learning research and Software Engineering. I love to make an impact in my community and inspire curious people to do the same. I've previously worked at NVIDIA as an intern, and now partake in full-time research associated with LLMs, Robotics and self-study diffusion models (+ All the math behind these things).
